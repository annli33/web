    <h2> How Does SKY Work? </h2>
      <p> 
        There are seven different maps in this game, starting with the Isle of Dawn, 
        the starting point of everyone who first begin this game. Chronologically, the
        other maps are Daylight Prairie, Hidden Forest, Valley of Triumph, Golden Wasteland, 
        Vault of Knowledge, and finally Eye of Eden. Players gather winged
        lights, spirits, and candles along the journey. As players gather more winged lights, 
        they gain more wings that aid the playor to fly farther distances.
      </p>

        Here is one of a scene in the Hidden Forest:

        Candle torches are used for unlocking unique outfits for each playor, some that requires
        in-app purchases. Some playors farm candles everyday for two hours, while others are more
        loose on collection of items. Candles can be traded for hearts to unlock different outfits, such as the blue cape in this image.

        For most playors, the most exciting aspect of this game is probably the release of new 
        seasons that lasts for 70 days per season. Every season brings new maps, spirits, and most
        importantly, oufits and items that users yearn for.  This is the currect season: Season of Dreams

    <h2> Why Many Enjoy SKY </h2>
      <p>
        Some people enjoy the challenge of journeying through the different stages 
        and maps. Others enjoy collecting the different outfits and playing the 
        different instruments. This is a 
        <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaHfqdxgXAQ&ab_channel=punkcricket"> Full Wardrobe </a>
        (not the latest though) that can be valued up to 2k dollars if sold to other players.

      <p>
        For me personally, I enjoy the art styles of this game. The landscapes of
        the different maps have their own unique style and theme. Sometimes when I'm 
        bored, I'll go to one of my favorite maps (right now it's the new Dream 
        Season map) and just listen to the soothing bgm and observe the strangers coming by.
      </p>

        But honestly after a few weeks or months of playing SKY, it will feel really
        bland and boring at times. What SKY really grasps to keep users to stay are 
        the acquaintances and friends that they met along the journey. This is someone I met from this game that made me continue SKY.
