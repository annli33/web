    <h2> What is SKY? </h2>
      <p> 
        SKY: Children of the Light is a free mobile game available to the iOS and 
        Andriod platform, and soon on the Nintendo Switch.

    <h2> How Does SKY Work? </h2>
      <p> 
        There are seven different maps in this game, starting with the Isle of Dawn, 
        the starting point of everyone who first launch this game.
      </p>
    
    <h2> Why Many Enjoy SKY </h2>
      <p>
        Some people enjoy the challenge of journeying through the different stages 
        and maps. Others enjoy collecting the different outfits and playing the 
        different instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me personally, I enjoy the art styles of this game. The landscapes of
        the different maps have their own unique style and theme. Sometimes when I'm 
        bored, I'll go to one of my favorite maps (right now it's the new Dream 
        Season map) and just listen to the soothing bgm.
      </p>
      <p>
        But honestly after a few weeks or months of playing SKY, it will feel really
        bland and boring at some times.
